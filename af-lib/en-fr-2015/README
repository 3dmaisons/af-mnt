IWSLT 2015 evaluation campaign: test sets for MT track

# Copyright: TED Conference LLC
# License: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0

This directory includes the evaluation sets for one of the language
pairs of the MT track; the pair consists of English on one side and on
the other side a language from this list:

- French, German, Chinese, Czech, Thai, Vietnamese

With some exceptions specified below, for each pair x-y of languages,
the xml files

IWSLT14.TED.tst2014.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT14.TED.tst2014.x-y.y.xml
IWSLT14.TED.tst2015.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT14.TED.tst2015.x-y.y.xml

are provided. tst2015 files are the official test set of this edition
of the evaluation campaign, while tst2014 are the progressive test
sets. The exceptions regard the following pairs:

en<->{cs,th,vi}: no progressive test set is released
de ->en: TEDX test sets are released instead of TED-based sets
de<->en: no reference file is available 

The TEDX-based test sets are the same as proposed for the ASR/SLT
tracks.

Each TED-based tst2015 evaluation set includes as many as possible TED
talks from a common set of the 12 talks listed at the end of this
file.

Each talk defines a single document, for which metadata are provided
in the following tags:

<url>: the url of the page with the text
<description>: a brief description of the talk
<keywords>: keywords of the talk
<talkid>: a numeric identifier of the talk
<title>: the title of the talk

Text is segmented in sentences. Segments can include more than one
sentence.

UTF8 encoding is used.  The simplified set of characters is employed
for Chinese text, and no segmentation/preprocessing has been applied.

Notes:

- Thai texts are segmented according to the guideline available here:
    http://hltshare.fbk.eu/IWSLT2015/InterBEST2009Guidelines-2.pdf
  and defined at InterBEST 2009:
    http://thailang.nectec.or.th/interbest/

- The German TEDX talks are transcribed as they are spoken. Therefore,
  in some cases the ending 'e' of German words is not written
  (e.g. glaub' instead of glaube). The same happens for the beginning
  of the German indefinite article. If you do not address this in your
  translation system, you can use the following simple replacement:

  sed -e "s/' /e /g" -e "s/'n /ein /g" -e "s/'ne /eine /g" -e "s/'nem /einem /g" -e "s/'nen /einen /g" -e "s/'ner /einer /g"
